Hi there! 
I hold a Master's degree in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from the University of Bath and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Brighton. Currently, I contribute to innovative projects at P2i Limited and have previously played a key role at Brillopak Limited. My work at Brillopak included the development of high-speed pick and place robotic systems and designing control systems for various industries.
Beyond my professional roles, I have a keen interest in non-invasive brain classification tasks. My link to [LinkedIN](https:www.linkedin.com/in/gokulan-nithianandam) profile. Explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects and experiences!
