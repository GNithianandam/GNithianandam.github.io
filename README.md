## Work Experience
**P2i Limited – Oxford, UK. (_June 2023 - Present_)**
# Siemen's TIA Portal | Profibus | Profinet | .NET | MariaDB | Beijer's IX Developer
- Engineered a robust Electrical Resistivity test software leveraging the .NET framework. The software seamlessly communicates with the Power Supply and Multimeter through SCPI commands, ensuring efficient and precise data acquisition. The acquired results are meticulously computed and stored in a CSV file for convenient analysis and reporting.
- Developed a user-centric Human-Machine Interface (HMI) using Beijer IX Developer for an innovative development machine, placing a strong emphasis on seamless narration. Engineered a sophisticated script facilitating communication with an external database, enabling comprehensive functionality for logging, user management, and recipe management. The HMI adheres meticulously to IEC standards, ensuring a reliable and standardized interface for optimal performance.
- Engineered a Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) authenticator application utilizing the .NET framework. Seamlessly integrated this app with the existing Human-Machine Interface (HMI) software to enhance authentication processes. The result is a robust and secure solution that ensures improved access control and heightened security measures.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
