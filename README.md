Hi there! 
I hold a Master's degree in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from the University of Bath and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Brighton. Currently, I contribute to innovative projects at P2i Limited and have previously played a key role at Brillopak Limited. My work at Brillopak included the development of high-speed pick and place robotic systems and designing control systems for various industries.
Beyond my professional roles, I have a keen interest in non-invasive brain classification tasks.Explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects and experiences!

## Work Experience
### P2i Limited ‚Äì Oxford, UK. (_June 2023 - Present_)

P2i is a technology company specializing in liquid-repellent nano-coating solutions that make electronic devices and textiles water-resistant. Their technology creates an invisible barrier on surfaces, protecting them from water damage and enhancing durability.

- Engineered a robust Electrical Resistivity test software leveraging the .NET framework. The software seamlessly communicates with the Power Supply and Multimeter through SCPI commands, ensuring efficient and precise data acquisition. The acquired results are meticulously computed and stored in a CSV file for convenient analysis and reporting.
- Developed a user-centric Human-Machine Interface (HMI) using Beijer IX Developer for an innovative development machine, placing a strong emphasis on seamless narration. Engineered a sophisticated script facilitating communication with an external database, enabling comprehensive functionality for logging, user management, and recipe management. The HMI adheres meticulously to IEC standards, ensuring a reliable and standardized interface for optimal performance.
- Engineered a Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) authenticator application utilizing the .NET framework. Seamlessly integrated this app with the existing Human-Machine Interface (HMI) software to enhance authentication processes. The result is a robust and secure solution that ensures improved access control and heightened security measures.

## Projects
### Classification of Motor Imagery tasks üß†

The project's major goal is finding the optimal combination of approaches to decode motor
imagery task with less data and achieving a higher classification accuracy by performing a
comparison study between combination of Deep Learning models and data augmentation
methods.[Project Link](https://github.com/GNithianandam/EEG-Motor-Imagery-classification) <br>
**_Technologies used:_** Tensorflow, Python, Deep Learning, Neuroscience

### Sofware development for bolt making machine üî©

Conducted remote programming and testing of bolt-making machines for an Australian client. Configured Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) based on Omron technology. Established serial communication protocols with both facing and drilling machines. Additionally, integrated Omron servo drives for other critical processes. <br>
**_Technologies used:_** Omron sysmac studio, Ethercat, Serial Communication, Servo drives

### AquaMetrics: Managing Swim Sessions and Performance Data üèäüèº

Developed and implemented swim training application to elevate the swimming experience through the seamless integration of MySQL and the .NET framework. This application serves as a comprehensive tool for swimmers, coaches, and fitness enthusiasts to meticulously record, analyze, and enhance their swim sessions. <br>
**_Technologies used:_** MySQL, .Net

### Enhancing Wildfire Detection from UAV Imagery: A Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation Approach

Implemented pre-trained deep learning model MobileNetV2 to realize transfer learning technique and data augmentation methodology to detect wildfires using UAV. The MobileNetV2 is trained and validated with the help of the MATLAB software's Deep Network Designer. <br>
**_Technologies used:_** MATLAB, MobileNetV2

### Apple pack QC
Used YoloV8 object detection algorithm to detect the defective apple and counting number of apples in a pack. The bad packs are detected and rejected using servo driven arm. The application is implemened using a web application developed using streamlit. Furthermore, the results are stored in the MYSQL database as part of the MES. In addition, the application provides user authentication and managements where the users credentials are encrypted using SHA512 and stored in the database.
